// Did the page actually receive the input we just dispatched?
//
// ensurePageVisibleForInput (profiles.ts) decides BEFORE the dispatch whether a
// tab should take input, and its answer is a deduction: "selected tab +
// throttling off = inputtable". Measured 2026-10-02, that deduction was wrong
// for a window fully covered by another app: click, press-key and type all
// answered ok while the page received no event at all and painted no frame
// (requestAnimationFrame never fired in 2.5 s). A scripted login spent four
// clicks on that. The cause is fixed at boot (chromium-switches.ts); this check
// stays, because the next way for input to vanish will not announce itself
// either.
//
// So the dispatch is checked AFTER the fact, on evidence: a one-shot capture
// listener is armed in the page, the input is sent, and the listener is read
// back. No event = the command fails, instead of a success nobody can trust.
//
// The check only speaks when it can know. Input aimed at an iframe is handled
// by another document, and an input that navigates takes the probe away with
// the page: both read as "unknown", and unknown never fails a command.
//
// Pure (script strings + a verdict), so it is unit-testable without Electron;
// the evaluation and the dispatch stay in profiles.ts.
