# Build, sign, notarize and zip the PUBLISHED macOS app for one architecture.
# Sourced by bin/release.sh. Not executable on its own.
#
# Needs MIRA_RELEASE_IDENTITY (the Developer ID Application certificate, without
# its prefix) and MIRA_NOTARY_PROFILE (a `notarytool store-credentials` keychain
# profile); bin/release.sh checks both before it bumps anything.
#
# build_release_zip <outputDir> <version> <arch> leaves the zip and its .sha256 in
# <outputDir> and sets RELEASE_ZIP to the zip's name. <arch> is arm64 or x64, and
# need not be this Mac's: the native addons are compiled for it by node-gyp
# (`--arch`, package.json build:addon:*) and electron-builder packs the Electron
# of that architecture. Verified 2026-10-06 on an arm64 Mac: the x64 app holds
# only x86_64 Mach-O files, passes `codesign --verify --deep --strict`, and its
# three addons load in the x64 Electron under Rosetta.
#
# Side effect: native/*/build/Release ends up holding the LAST architecture built.
# bin/release.sh builds this Mac's architecture last, so `npm run dev` keeps
# loading addons it can run.
#
# Build, sign and zip steps first written by Robin Bonduelle (PR #2), 2026-09-26.

# Download Electron's zip for one architecture into a local cache, checked against
# Electron's own SHASUMS256.txt, and point release-build.cjs at it
# (MIRA_ELECTRON_DIST). electron-builder's built-in download once stalled for its
# full 10-minute timeout on the x64 zip, while curl fetched the same file in 6 s
# (2026-10-06).
